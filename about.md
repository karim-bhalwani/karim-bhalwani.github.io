I’m Karim Bhalwani, a Solutions Architect with a long background in building and evolving data and AI systems that are practical, reliable, and easy to operate.

I enjoy learning new technologies and putting them to work in real systems. Curiosity is a big driver for me, but I try to balance it with discipline and validation. I like to understand how things actually behave, not just how they are described. Trust, then verify.

This blog is a personal space where I write about projects, experiments, and ideas as I continue to learn and refine my approach to architecture and system design.

### What I Write About

- Solution architecture and system design
- Data engineering and analytics patterns
- Practical uses of Generative AI
- Lessons learned from building and iterating on systems

The focus is on clear thinking and practical outcomes rather than theory.

### Purpose of This Blog

This site is personal and independent. It does not represent any employer or organization. The content reflects my own interests, experiences, and ongoing learning.

I use this space to think out loud, share patterns that may be useful to others, and keep a record of how my thinking evolves over time.
